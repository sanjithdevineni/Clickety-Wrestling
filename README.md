# Clickety Wrestling
ShellHacks 2025 - Project

I, along with 3 teammates developed a game we named 'Clickety Wrestling', during the ShellHacks 2025 hackathon. 

We used the Godot Game Engine to develop our game.
We primarily using Godot's built in script - GDScript - to develop the functionality of the game layer by layer.
